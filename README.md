# Hi :wave:, I'm Sebastian
I'm a frontend developer from Poland. I love JavaScript ecosystem and experiments in CSS. I never stop learning.

-  :yellow_heart: JavaScript

-  :computer: Iâ€™m currently working on [Cat Cafe Mruczkowo in Gliwice)](https://github.com/sebast4an/cat-cafe-mruczkowo-website)  

- :bulb: I public my experiments in CSS on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/sebast4an)  

- :black_nib: I sometimes write articles on my blog [interesujacyblog.pl](https://interesujacyblog.pl/)
